# DataScience
Data Science projects:

Some will be inspired by courses:
 
 E.g. I intend to do my own projects, inspired by each section of the Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp' course by Jose Portilla, however I'm going to do different ones, on the same topics, for my own understanding. E.g. I might do a project using scikitlearn for the K Means Clustering Algorithm, however I'll change the dataset and make a few other changes also.
 
NOTE: All resources shared on GitHub are my own. I reference courses/companies that have helped me (such as 'Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp'). For the sake of the course providers, I WILL NOT share resources that need to be paid for. 

All I'm trying to do is showcase my skills in the form of projects and visualisations, rather than just a certificate!!
